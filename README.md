# Hey 👋

My name is Carla Reis 👩🏼‍🇧🇷

I’m a **Computer Scientist** (B.Sc. in Computer Science at [Universidade Feevale](https://www.feevale.br), with Academic Merit distinction), working in software development since 2019.  💻

I started my career with **low-code development based on .NET**, evolving to work across **Front End, Back End and Databases** in large-scale systems. Today, I combine this expertise with personal projects in **Node.js, React.js and Mobile Apps**.

✨ Passionate about technology, problem solving and sharing knowledge. Always open to new challenges and continuous learning.
